# This document holds the test sentences and the answers for their grammatical constructions.
#
# Currently, I have supplied it with sentences from some chapters in Wheelock that I have picked out. The ones that I have not
# included consist of constructions that I do not intend to implement right away (as they have tended to introduce some forms or 
# uses early that will later make up a composite whole). I have included what would appear to be the correct grammar, syntactically
# and semantically, for each word and for the sentence as a whole. Of course, it is currently a rough answer key, as I have not standardized
# neither the storage nor the printing format. However, this answer key will give me a good start in considering these things.
