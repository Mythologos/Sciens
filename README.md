## Introduction
This is a (Classical) Latin rule-based parser and chunker.
It began as a project for a senior capstone course
in the fall of 2018. As a venture into natural
language processing (NLP) and the complexities of
computational linguistics, this project is
an endeavor to apply what had been learned
in a reasonable and doable manner. 

However, given the complexities of language even on a
fundamental level, only the parser was adequately
created. The chunker currently only captures
prepositional phrases, as those are relatively
formulaic in nature. Furthermore, quite a bit
of this code needs simplification and further
abstraction to attain a more workable state.
On the other hand, it serves as a solid start
that will (hopefully) be built on to become
something useful and effective.
